# auto_update "yes"
# bind_to_address "127.0.0.1"
# restore_paused "yes"
# max_output_buffer_size "16384"

# audio_output {
# 	type "pulse"
# 	name "pulse"
# }

# audio_output {

# Set with the flags "-e", "-u","-o pipefail" cause the script to fail
# if certain things happen, which is a good thing.  Otherwise, we can
# get hidden bugs that are hard to discover.
