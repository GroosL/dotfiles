First day of (actually) using Emacs. Ever since I started using Vim
/NVim I knew what Emacs was but never actually used it. Sure, I had used Doom Emacs and even GNU Emacs before but this yesterday I decided to ACTUALLY use it. So I decided to watch some tutorials on Youtube before going to bed but gave up on that tutorial (not because it was bad but because it was not what I was looking for. This morning I found a great tutorial in my native language and started customizing and installing packages on Emacs, I even installed Evil mode and now I'm writing my own diary! Who would've thought?

FINALLY I FOUND IT! With the crypto market exploding I have finally found a way to really make some profit from it!! Create a website where people send you crypto and you buy stuff for them, like steam games or other stuff. With a little taxation of course hahahaha
